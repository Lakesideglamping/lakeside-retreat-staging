/* Security Fixes — Placeholder
 * This file was referenced in index.html but was never committed to the repo.
 * The security functionality is handled by:
 * - middleware/auth.js (JWT verification, input sanitization)
 * - middleware/rate-limit.js (rate limiting)
 * - helmet CSP headers in server.js
